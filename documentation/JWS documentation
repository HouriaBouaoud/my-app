JSON Web Tokens are an open, 
industry-standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties. 
A JWT is a JSON response that is defined in RFC 7519 as 
a safe way to represent a set of information between two parties. 
The token is composed of a header, a payload, and a signature.



JWT flow
Since we are working in a microservice-based architecture, 
we have got different microservices, one being the Authentication Service. 
This is one of the backend services thatâ€™s written in .NET Core API, 
which retrieves a user claim based on a reference token in a domain cookie and generates a JWT for this claim.

If a valid JWT is returned, 
the call is forwarded to the corresponding service, 
and the JWT is passed in the request header as an OAuth bearer token for 
further authorization by the backing service.
